# Weather Dashboard

This page is a weather dashboard allowing the user to search any city and see the current weather conditions, temperature, wind speed, and UV index. UV index is color coordinated as follows: Green (low), Yellow (mild), Orange (moderate), Red (high), Purple (extreme). A 5 day forecast will also be displayed showing day of the week, date, weather condition, temperature high, temperature low, and humidity. Search history is saved at the bottom of the page as an ongoing list. Prior searches can be clicked from the list and will re-populate the page with data from that city.
